# xml-examples
This repo extends the eclipse demo-project "XMLExamples" with some examples that I develop during the lecture and lab of my course "Datamanagement with XML" held at FH Vorarlberg. The eclipse project has been renamed to "xml-examples" for this purpose.

## Requirements
This repo contains a project for the Eclipse IDE, hence, you will need a running Eclipse installation. I strongly recommend a recent "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers". For me, the easiest way to do that is by using the eclipse installer, which you can download here: [Eclipse Installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer).

In order to download this project, or better "git clone" this project, I recommend a local installation of the git command line tools on your development machine.

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repo
   * **If you have a GitHub account**:
     * In GitHub: fork this repo into your personal GitHub account.
     * On your local machine: create a directory outside of your eclipse workspace.
     * Change into that directory and clone your forked repo to your development machine:
     
     `git clone https://github.com/<your git account>/xml-examples.git`
     
   * If you **don't have a GitHub** account:
     * On your local machine: create a directory outside of your eclipse workspace.
     * Change into that directory and clone the repo e.g. on a bash command line:
     
	`git clone https://github.com/geschwaerzler/xml-examples.git`

1. Import the project into eclipse:
   * Select menu "File" > "Importâ€¦"
   * in the dialog open folder "General" select "Existing Projects into Workspace" and click button "Next >"
   * use the option "Select root directory"
   * chose the directory "xml-examples", that has been created by the  _git clone_  above and click button "Finish".
